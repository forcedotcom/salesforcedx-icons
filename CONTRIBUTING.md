# Governance Model

## Published Primarily to Provide Icons to Another Project

The intent and goal of open sourcing this project is to have a central location to build font files for use in Salesforce's VS Code extension projects. This repository generates two icon font families used in Visual Studio Code extensions: SFDX icons (Salesforce DX Icons) for Salesforce-specific features, Seti for file type indicators, and Codicons for UI elements and actions.
